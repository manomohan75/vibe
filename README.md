# Employee form (React + Vite)

This is a simple React single-page app that lets you enter an employee ID and name, save the entry, and preview the saved details.

## Getting started

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
2. Start the local dev server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
3. Open the URL shown in the terminal (defaults to http://localhost:5173/). Enter an employee ID and name, click **Save**, and the summary panel will reflect the submitted values. Use **Clear** to reset the form.

To build for production, run `npm run build` and preview with `npm run preview`.
